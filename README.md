## Getting Started

To run you need to have npm, and the ng-cli installed.

- `npm install`
- `ng serve`

## Deploy

The following task is currently being used to deploy the app

- `ng build`

The GitHub Pages workflow injects the public legal contact details at deploy time. Configure these repository Actions secrets before deploying:

- `LEGAL_NAME`
- `LEGAL_STREET`
- `LEGAL_POSTAL_CODE`
- `LEGAL_CITY`
- `LEGAL_COUNTRY`
- `LEGAL_EMAIL`

The values are not committed to the repository, but they are included in the deployed legal pages and are publicly visible there.
